/**
 * @brief Processses a branch instruction
 * 
 * The branch instruction must follow one of the following formats:
 *     - b<cond> <expression> - jumps to the instruction at the specified address if the condition
 *       holds (examples: beq 0x4122 or beq 1234)
 *     - b<cond> <label> - jumps to the instruction at the specified label if the condition
 *       holds (example: ble forloop)
 * 
 * @param symbols Map<char*, Token> mapping labels to the addresses they point to
 * @param tokens Vector<char*> representing the function to process
 * @param output Vector<int> representing the final executable
 * @param offset int representing the word offset of the function to process
 * @param instruction_num int representing the overall number of instructions to process
 * @note in the format b<cond> <expression> the value of the expression must be divisible by 4 and non-negative
 * @note the jump cannot be performed to the destination more than 2^26 from the address 8 bytes ahead of the branch instruction
